# Etc.
- unsortedSublistIndex
- maybe use same of Showcase's pieces to arbitrarily be able to sort data via human eyes
    - not needing to build special UI's for each target-sort-item type, but instead, just having a standard visualization set of motifs on a data-type basis
    - would have to do datatype-detection
- Facilitated Sort targets
    - photos
    - todos
- could facilitate a group-prioritization, as a sort-of six-sigma-project-planning-tool (ranking priorities across the team)
    - would need a disclaimer that the team must function like a democracy
- "approximated binary insertion" -- only need a certain amount of times

# IMPLEMENTATION PATH IDEAS
- start with a visualization that looks something like the visualization found in this:
... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OVB5pOZJug
    - gold for active item
    - grey for unsorted
    - green for sorted
- start with just the side-by-side view, building in React
- plug in, to the built-in sort() function,
    ... only problem is, you won't be able to bail out of this
    ... and sort() may behave strangely if you inject a long-blocking comparator in for it
- explore cocoa
    - be able to sort any abritrary list, but via commandline
- Showcase, Example


# Data Model
- Comparisons
    - timestamp
    - itemIdA
    - itemIdB
    - decisionTime (e.g. ~4seconds)
